# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to three different datasets. The primary goal is to explore the effectiveness of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data while retaining essential information.

## Techniques Implemented
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the original variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): A technique that converts a set of data points into a series of cosine functions with different frequencies, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data.
Independent Component Analysis (ICA): A method that separates a multivariate signal into additive, independent components, particularly useful for complex data structures where underlying signals are mixed.

## Datasets
Dataset 1: A dense data collection describing a specific image (67 rows × 62 columns).
Dataset 2: Dense dataset of noise collection, generated randomly (67 rows × 62 columns).
Dataset 3: Sparse data collection (67 rows × 62 columns).

## Results
PCA: Effective in reducing dimensionality while retaining variance, with an elbow point observed around index 10-15 for the datasets.
DCT: Follows a similar pattern to PCA, with a notable concentration of energy into a few significant coefficients.
ICA: Particularly useful for identifying independent underlying factors, with the importance of components assessed through the sum of absolute values in the mixing matrix.
